    "## Introduction: Kalman Filtering for Attitude Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "An IMU has x-y-z accelerometers (measuring linear acceleration) and x-y-z gyroscopes (measuring angular velocity). Using these measurements, we would like to measure the tilt angle of the teensyimu board. Here, tilt refers to the roll (rotation about the x axis) and pitch (rotation about the y axis). Yaw (rotation about the z axis) is unobservable when only given a gyro and an accelerometer, as we will discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive solution for recovering tilt angle is to integrate the gyroscope measurements over time. However, noise and biases in the gyro measuring process would quickly cause this integration to diverge. Alternatively, accelerometer measurements can provide a measure of the angles, but these measurements are noisy and become distorted for  an accelerated body. By *fusing* these measurement sources together in a Kalman filter, we can leverage the best of both measurement sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for simplicity, our solution will only be valid for small tilt angles, less than $\\pm90$ deg in each axis.\n",

    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accelerometer\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from hw2-lab, the measurement model of the accelerometer is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y}_\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{f} + \\mathbf{b}_\\mathbf{a} + \\boldsymbol{\\eta},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{f}=R^\\text{b}_\\text{w}(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{g})$ is the specific force expressed in the body frame, $\\mathbf{a}$ is the linear acceleration experienced by the accelerometer and $\\mathbf{g}$ denotes the gravity vector, both expressed in the world coordinate frame. The $3\\times 3$ matrix $R^\\text{b}_\\text{w}\\in\\text{SO}(3)$ encodes the *attitude*, or orientation, of the accelerometer w.r.t the world frame. Noise in accelerometer readings is captured with the zero-mean Gaussian process $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}(t)$ which has $\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{\\eta}(t)\\boldsymbol{\\eta}(t+\\tau)^\\top]=\\Sigma_\\mathbf{a}\\delta(\\tau)$ and $\\mathbf{b}_\\mathbf{a}$, which is a slowly time-varying bias. Depending on the duration of the experiment, this bias can either be treated as a constant or as a random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accelerometers as Inclination Sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "An accelerometer can be used to measure the static tilt angle (about x and y). Here, *static* emphasizes that the tilt angle is only valid when the accelerometer is not accelerating, i.e., the force of gravity is the only external force acting on the sensor. Using trigonometry, the tilt angles about x and y can be recovered given the accelerometer measurement. For example, see [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/using-an-accelerometer-for-inclination-sensing) for figures, equations, and discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gyroscopes\n",
    "\n",
    "The angular rate $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}=\\begin{bmatrix}p & q & r\\end{bmatrix}^\\top$ of the body of the teensyimu with respect to the inertial frame, expressed in the body frame, is measured by the rate gyro as\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\Sigma_\\boldsymbol{\\omega})$ is the noise introduced in the measurement process and $\\mathbf{b}_\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is a constant or slowly time-varying bias (i.e., $\\dot{\\mathbf{b}}_\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\approx0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gyros typically have a sample rate of 500 Hz, 1 kHz, or 8 kHz.\n",
    "They are great at capturing high-frequency dynamics and are incredibly useful, especially over short time windows.\n",
    "However, due to the low-frequency bias $\\mathbf{b}_\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, simply integrating gyros over long timescales is unwise (e.g., more than tens of seconds).\n",

    "## Advice\n",
    "Start with a relatively simple trajectory to ensure that the attitude estimation code is working. Keep the trajectories short in duration since the drift due to gyroscope bias starts becoming significant. In particular, the predicted yaw angle deteriorates in quality for longer trajectories since gyroscope is the only source of information for yaw. In real world, periodic resets of the attitude (yaw) are carried out using other sensing modalities."
